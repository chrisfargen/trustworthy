          <p>Thank you for participating in our study.</p>
          
          <p>Today you will be provided with different people or organizations and statements by these entities.  We're interested in how <em>trustworthy</em> you find each as a source of information about various issues. You will be provided with a scale from 1 (not at all trustworthy) to 7 (very trustworthy). We're also interested in your beliefs about the truth of statements. You will be provided with a scale from 1 (not at all believable) to 7 (very believable).</p>
          
          <p>For example, you might be asked how trustworthy you would find the Oxford English Dictionary with respect to providing you with the correct spelling for a new word.  You would likely rate this source as very trustworthy.   However, if you were asked how trustworthy a 2nd grader was to provide you with an accurate spelling for the same word, you might find this source less trustworthy and give it a lower rating.</p>
          
          <p>Similarly, you might be asked how believable is the statement that the word canine is a synonym for dog. You would rate this statement as very believable. However, if you were asked how believable is the statement that the word feline is a synonym for dog, you would find this less believable and give it a lower rating.</p>
          
          <p>Before we begin, you will be provided with a form that states your rights as a participant in the study.</p>

          <h2>Informed Consent: Studies of Concept Learning Online</h2>

          <h3>Introduction and Background Information</h3>

          <p>You are invited to participate in a research study.  The study is being conducted by Prof. Patrick Shafto, PhD.  The study is sponsored by the University of Louisville, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences.</p>

          <h3>Purpose</h3>

          <p>The purpose of this study is to understand how people learn and make guesses about the world. In particular, we are interested in how people's experience and knowledge affect how they think and make predictions about the world.</p>

          <h3>Procedures</h3>

          <p>In this study, you will be asked to answer a series of questions. These questions will ask what you think about different scenarios or sets of objects. There are no right or wrong answers. You may decline to answer any questions that make you uncomfortable. Depending on the number of questions, the study should take between 1 and 30 minutes to complete.</p>

          <h3>Potential Risks</h3>

          <p>The only risks are those inherent in using a computer for 30 minutes at a reasonable level of intensity. These may include, but are not limited to issues such as wrist pain and muscle fatigue. Although unlikely, there may be unforeseen risks.</p>

          <h3>Benefits</h3>

          <p>The possible benefits of this study include improved computer-based methods for finding structure in data, improved understanding of human reasoning in real-world settings, and/or improved computer-based training methods.</p>

          <h3>Compensation</h3>

          <p>You will receive monetary compensation for participating in this experiment at the rate detailed when you chose this job.</p>

          <h3>Confidentiality</h3>

          <p>Total privacy cannot be guaranteed. Individuals from the Department of Brain and Psychological Sciences, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Human Subjects Protection Program Office (HSPPO), and other regulatory agencies may inspect these records. Your privacy will be protected to the extent permitted by law.  If the results from this study are published, your name will not be made public. The resulting data will not contain identifying information; your data will be assigned a random number that will not be tied to your name.</p>

          <h3>Voluntary Participation</h3>

          <p>Taking part in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to take part at all. If you decide to be in this study you may stop taking part at any time. If you decide not to be in this study or if you stop taking part at any time, you will not lose any benefits for which you may qualify.</p>

          <h3>Questions or Concerns</h3>

          <p>"If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about the research study, please contact: Patrick Shafto, 502-852-6197. If you have any questions about your rights as a research subject, you may call the Human Subjects Protection Program Office at (502) 85288. You can discuss any questions about your rights as a research subject, in private, with a member of the Institutional Review Board (IRB). You may also call this number if you have other questions about the research, and you cannot reach the research staff, or want to talk to someone else. The IRB is an independent committee made up of people from the University community, staff of the institutions, as well as people from the community not connected with these institutions. The IRB has reviewed this research study. If you have concerns or complaints about the research or research staff and you do not wish to give your name, you may call 17267. This is a 24 hour hot line answered by people who do not work at the University of Louisville.</p>

          <p>If want to participate in the study, please to advance to the experiment. If you <span style="text-decoration: underline">do not want to</span> participate leave this website.</p>

          <p>This is the scale you will be using to select how trustworthy you find each source. Note that if you would find the source not at all trustworthy, you should give the source a score of 1. If you find the source very trustworthy, you should give the source a score of 7.  Please try to use the whole scale (from 1 to 7) as much as possible.</p>

          <p>Most modern theories of decision making recognize the fact that decisions do not take place in a vaccuum. Individual preferences and knowledge, along with situational variables can greatly impact the decision process. In order to facilitate our reseach on decision making we are interested in knowing certain factors about you, the decision maker. Specifically, we are interested in whether you actually take the time to read the directions; if not, then some of our manipulations that rely on changes in the instructions will be ineffective. So, in order to demonstrate that you have read the instructions, please ignore the question below, as well as the continue button. Instead, select "Other..." from the options provided and type "I have read the instructions." Thank you very much.</p>
