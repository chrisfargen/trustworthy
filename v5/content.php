	<p>Thank you for participating in our study.</p>
	<p>Today you will be provided with different people or organizations and statements by these entities.  We're interested in how <em>trustworthy</em> you find each as a source of information about various issues. You will be provided with a scale from 1 (not at all trustworthy) to 7 (very trustworthy). We're also interested in your beliefs about the truth of statements. You will be provided with a scale from 1 (not at all believable) to 7 (very believable).</p>
	<p>For example, you might be asked how trustworthy you would find the Oxford English Dictionary with respect to providing you with the correct spelling for a new word.  You would likely rate this source as very trustworthy.   However, if you were asked how trustworthy a 2nd grader was to provide you with an accurate spelling for the same word, you might find this source less trustworthy and give it a lower rating.</p>
	<p>Similarly, you might be asked how believable is the statement that the word canine is a synonym for dog. You would rate this statement as very believable. However, if you were asked how believable is the statement that the word feline is a synonym for dog, you would find this less believable and give it a lower rating.</p>
	<p>Before we begin, you will be provided with a form that states your rights as a participant in the study.</p>
